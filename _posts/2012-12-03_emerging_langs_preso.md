## Visi Presentation at the Emerging Languages Camp

[Alex Payne](https://twitter.com/al3x) invited me to present
at the [2012 Emerging Languages Camp](http://blog.goodstuff.im/awesome-loop) in Saint Louis this year.

The conference was jam packed with some of the most amazing
languages and language developers.

Here's a [video of my presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Visi).
It's a pretty good representation of the goals and motivations of the
Visi language as well as the current state of the code.

Enjoy.
