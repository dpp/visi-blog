<p>I want to draw a distinction between the Visi language and the Visi.Pro platform.</p>
<p />
<div>The Visi language is an open source, MPL 1.1 licensed, collection of software and other intellectual property (documentation, etc.) &nbsp;While I, David Pollak, am the only one currently working on Visi, I welcome contributions from others. &nbsp;I am focusing my efforts on making Visi work well on iOS, Mac OS X, and in non-GUI mode on Linux. &nbsp;I am doing this because I intend to build a tablet/cloud business with Visi.Pro (which I'll get to in a minute). &nbsp;I have spoken with folks from ThoughtWorks who think Visi would make a great web development platform. &nbsp;I agree and if these folks want to contribute to Visi or fork Visi and do a web platform based on it, very, very cool. &nbsp;If folks want to do an Android version or a Windows version or any other version of Visi, I wholeheartedly support the efforts. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because the value of a computer language is based on the network of users that know how to program in it. &nbsp;I want to make Visi as&nbsp;ubiquitous&nbsp;as Excel. &nbsp;I want every B-school student to think in Visi. &nbsp;I want to see a sea of former PHP developers coding in Visi. &nbsp;I aim to make Visi bigger than Java, bigger than PHP, bigger than any computer language, ever (yeah, I'm not being modest here.)</div>
<p />
<div>Visi.Pro is a commercial venture based on the Visi language. &nbsp;It is the thing that will ultimately help fund Visi development but also give folks a way to use Visi applications on this iOS and OS X machines, but to have a seamless cloud component to their applications. &nbsp;One of the attributes of the Visi language is that it supports a migratory locus of computing. &nbsp;You can move the computation around to suit the current data locus and other factors (thanks Ian Clark for the idea.) &nbsp;Visi.Pro is a focused venture based on enabling a particular class of users who use a particular class of devices to do beautiful and amazing things. &nbsp;I will gladly discuss my choice of platform with potential investors and potential large-scale customers and with Apple, whose blessing Visi.Pro will need to succeed on iOS.</div>
<p />
<div>As we discuss Visi, you all will know that I have commercial motivations for my contributions to Visi. &nbsp;But my contributions will hopefully not be the sole and exclusive contributions to Visi. &nbsp;If you have a hankering for making Visi run on your platform of choice, be it open or not, please join the discussion, please contribute code, please make Visi more than I can ever make it by myself.</div>
